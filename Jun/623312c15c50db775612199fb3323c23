CONFEDERATIONS Cup organisers will stage a pre-match ceremony before the final to commemorate the death on the field of Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe. Foe collapsed and died in a 2003 Cofederations Cup semifinal against Colombia and, after his death, was found to have a heart condition. Fifa president Sepp Blatter said yesterday  that the tragic event had  led to improved safety measures for international matches, which now have doctors on the bench or paramedics capable of using defibrillators. "What is important is that since this [Foe] case, football has learned about the problem of cardiological disease," Blatter said. "It's impossible to control the millions and millions of football players but in Fifa's competitions, not only at the highest level,  we are." Blatter also said a survey of young players at a competition in Egypt that was a precursor  to this year's Under-17 World Cup in Nigeria had shown that 60percent of the players had never seen a doctor. "So we have a lot of work," Blatter said.    - Sapa-AP
